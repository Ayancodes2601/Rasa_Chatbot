# Rasa_Chatbot
This is a project based on the Rasa open source software to make a chatbot for telegram. In this project I have made a simple telegram chatbot/FAQ bot using the Rasa software to train the bot and based on which it gives the answers to the questions asked by the user.

Rasa is an open source software which is based on the Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Natural Language Understanding(NLU) models. Other than the NLP and NLU, we can see the dialogue management and integrations with various messaging applications like facebook, telegram, whatsapp, etc. Using the Rasa software, it would be easy for us to enter the future of the AI world.

This project is just a small representation of how the Rasa software can be made to work without much hassle and can be handled without any problem. Further upgrades can be added to this project by including voice features to make it a voice bot and not a mere chatbot, and by making it interact like a normal human.

Hoping to make further upgrades soon. Thanks!!
